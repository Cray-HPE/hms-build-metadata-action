## Release model

When you make changes you should tag the code branch with an vX.Y.Z semver and move/create the vX tag.

the vX tag (eg v1) is used by the 'invoking' workflows.  The contract is that vX(n) MUST be backwards compatible.  
the vX.Y.Z tag is used to distinguish code changes as a release.
